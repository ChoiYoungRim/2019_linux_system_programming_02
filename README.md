This project files are simple real-time converting program from C file to Java file
, but it can only convert C files to Java files in limited circumstances.

If you want to run or check my project files, clone my files and do 'make' command to build an executable file 'ssu_score'.
After you did above recommendations, do './ssu_score [FILE_NAME] [OPTIONS]'. There are three files to convert which are 'q1.java'
,'q2.java' and 'q3.java'. After converting, there must be 4 C files which are 'q1.c', 'q2.c', 'q3.c' and 'Stack.c'.

Also, there are several options that you can use. If you do not input any option, the program will just convert the java file to C file.
If you use '-j' option, the program will show you the code that you want to convert.
If you use '-c' option, it will show you converted C code.
If you use '-p' option, it will print the java functions which are equivalent to converted C functions.
If you use '-f' option, it will print the sizes of java file and c file respectively.
If you use '-l' option, it will print the number of lines of both java file and c file.
If you use '-r' option, it will show you real-time converting between java file and c file.
